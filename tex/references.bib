	abstract = {This paper analyses the system of energy performance certificates in place in Ireland. We find that having a system with discrete energy-efficiency thresholds causes bunching among properties just on the more favorable side of the label cut-off points. This indicates that, in the region around the label thresholds, assessors tend to be extra lenient when evaluating the energy performance of dwellings. We examine possible reasons for this finding, including the market returns to energy efficiency using home sales data from the Irish property price register, and conclude that most likely assessors are trying to ingratiate homeowners to get repeat business. We find evidence of a partial disconnect between sellers' expectations and buyers' valuation of properties labeled as more efficient.},

	abstract = {Energy performance certiﬁcates (EPC) provide a measure of and raise awareness of the energy eﬃciency of homes. The Irish system of energy performance certiﬁcates comprises ﬁfteen alpha-numeric grades, which imposes fourteen discrete notches in an otherwise continuous scale. Visual evidence of bunching occurs in the distribution of EPC certiﬁcates on the favourable side of EPC grades among homes that have completed energy eﬃciency retroﬁts but not in the equivalent distribution of EPC certiﬁcates prior to completion of retroﬁts. Using a regression discontinuity design and estimation of a counter-factual distribution, evidence is found of bunching in the post-works distribution but not the pre-works distribution. We analyse whether statistical evidence exists of drivers of this bunching and whether sources of bunching can be identiﬁed. We ﬁnd that bunching is widespread but not systemic and ﬁnd discontinuities in the distribution of certain parameters of assessment (i.e. low energy lighting) which suggests their contribution toward bunching. With comparable EPC schemes across Europe the results have policy implications for other countries. Where continuous EPC scales are used, additional energy eﬃciency improvements may be achieved if a multi-point scale is considered. In countries where multipoint EPC scales are used, bunching of assessments is also likely to occur and quality control measures may be necessary to ensure that the bunching is due to genuine energy eﬃciency improvements and not a reﬂection of illicit activity.},

There is evidence that the process of creating an EPC introduces measurement error such that repeat assessments of the same property give diﬀerent ratings, compromising their reliability. This study presents a novel error analysis to estimate the size of this eﬀect, using repeated EPC assessments of 1.6 million existing dwellings in England and Wales. A statistical model of how measurement error contributes to variation between repeated measurements is set out, and exploratory data analysis is used to decide how to apply this model to the available data. The results predict that the one standard deviation measurement error decreases with EPC rating, from around ± 8.0 EPC points on a rating of 35 to ±2.4 on a rating of 85. This predicted error is higher than the limit recommended in UK guidance except in very eﬃcient buildings; it can also result in dwellings being rated in the wrong EPC band, for example it was estimated that 24\% of band D homes are rated as band C.},

By mitigating informational asymmetries on real estate markets, the conventional wisdom is that they will reduce energy use, increase energy-eﬃciency investments, and improve social welfare. We develop a model that partly contradicts these predictions. Although EPCs always improve social welfare in the absence of market failures other than asymmetric information, their impact on energy use and investments is ambiguous and depends both on the time horizon considered and the distribution of energy needs in the population. This implies that, in a second-best world where energy externalities are under-priced, EPCs can damage social welfare.},

The problems were categorized into three headings: the EPC system and calculation problems, problems in the regulation and inspection process and, finally, the perspective on the construction industry to the EPC system is examined in the case of Turkey. Deficiencies in the rating system and calculation, regulation and inspection, and perspective of the EPC system in Turkey were identified. Suggestions for the development of EPC in Turkey were made to make it comparable with the systems in EU countries. As one of the outcomes of the study, Turkey should focus on the use of renewable energy, taking into account its geographical advantage. In addition, a more detailed micro-zoning that focuses on regional differences should be carried out, and the authorities should introduce a better control mechanism for the EPC system.},

Over 15 million EPCs have been lodged, representing a valuable resource for research into the UK building stock. However, the EPC record has a reputation of containing multiple errors. In this work, we identify many such errors and quantify how common they are. We ﬁnd that 27\% of EPCs in the open EPC record display at least one ﬂag to suggests it is incorrect and estimate the true error rate of the EPC record to be between 36-62\%. Many of these errors are caused by EPC assessors disagreeing on building parameters such as ﬂoor type, wall type and built form. Additionally, ﬂats and maisonettes appear to cause more issues than other property types. This may be due to diﬃculties in assessing their location in the building and the nature of the surrounding space. We also suggest potential new methods of quality assurance which rely on machine learning and which could allow such errors to be avoided in the future.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses quality and impact issues concerning Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) by means of a dataset based upon the Swedish EPCs for single-family houses. Assuming that the quality of the certificates plays an important role for their impact, we examine to what extent various characteristics of the firms and experts issuing the certificates are influencing their assessments of energy consumption and energy conservation. Exploiting the information on biased assessments, we also investigate the relationship between the transaction price of a house and its EPC label. Doing so, we distinguish the attributes that can be observed by visiting the house and those that a buyer only can inform herself about through the EPC. Applying regression analyses we find that firm and expert characteristics matter quite a lot implying that the EPC-quality could be improved considerably by increasing the inter-rater reliability. The results also show that the price impact of the energy label is related to information that the buyers can obtain by visiting the house rather than to information uniquely provided by the EPCs. Hence, the EPCs per se are unlikely to stimulate energy conservation through the price mechanism.},

This is the first large-scale empirical study of this topic in England involving 333,095 dwellings sold at least twice in the period from 1995 to 2012. Applying hedonic regression and an augmented repeat sales regression, we find a positive relationship between the energy efficiency rating of a dwelling and the transaction price per square metre. The price effects of superior energy performance tend to be higher for terraced dwellings and flats compared to detached and semi-detached dwellings. The evidence is less clear-cut for rates of house price growth but remains supportive of a positive association. Overall, the results of this study suggest that energy efficiency labels have a measurable and significant impact on house prices in England.},

We develop an equilibrium model of the market for ratings and use it to examine possible origins of and cures for ratings inﬂation. In the model, asset issuers can shop for ratings – observe multiple ratings and disclose only the most favorable – before auctioning their assets. When assets are simple, agencies’ ratings are similar and the incentive to ratings shop is low. When assets are suﬃciently complex, ratings diﬀer enough that an incentive to shop emerges. Thus, an increase in the complexity of recently-issued securities could create a systematic bias in disclosed ratings, despite the fact that each ratings agency produces an unbiased estimate of the asset’s true quality. Increasing competition among agencies would only worsen this problem. Switching to an investor-initiated ratings system alleviates the bias, but could collapse the market for information.},

Firms sell a homogeneous good to rational consumers who incur search costs to learn prices. Search costs are endogenized by allowing obfuscation—firms have an unobservable action that increases the time needed to learn their price. One model involves search costs convex in shopping time. We show that slight convexity can dramatically alter the equilibrium price distribution. A second model examines an informational linkage between current and future search costs: consumers are uncertain about a component of search costs. Here, a signal‐jamming mechanism can lead to equilibrium obfuscation.},

These conflicts create two distortions. First, competition can reduce efficiency, as it facilitates ratings shopping. Second, ratings are more likely to be inflated during booms and when investors are more trusting. We also discuss efficiency-enhancing regulatory interventions.},

However, they might post lower prices but still charge higher markups than less prominent competitors only if they are also sufficiently more efficient. Our results suggest that when search is sequential, the role of prominence depends on whether it modifies the order or just the chances with which firms are sampled.},

Alternatives are inspected in a random order, one at a time, and only the rank order of the current alternative relative to the ones that have already been observed can be ascertained. At each period, the consumer may either accept the current alternative, continue to search and pay a fixed cost, or recall an alternative that has already been inspected. A recalled alternative is assumed to be available with a known probability. The consumer's goal is to select the overall best alternative from the fixed set. We describe the results of an experiment designed to test the optimal model and compare it to a behavioral decision model that incorporates local patterns of the observed sequence. Both set size and search cost are manipulated experimentally in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Our results show that cost and set size affect the amount of search in the predicted direction. However, in the two no-cost conditions subjects search too little in comparison to the optimal model, whereas in the two cost conditions they search too much. The behavioral decision rule that we propose provides a possible account for the observed pattern of the behavioral regularities.},

After comparing quality disclosure with other quality assurance mechanisms and describing a brief history of quality disclosure, we address two sets of theoretical issues. First, why don't sellers voluntarily disclose through a process of "unraveling" and, given the lack of unraveling, is it desirable to mandate seller disclosure? Second, when we rely on certifiers to act as the intermediary of quality disclosure, do certifiers necessarily report unbiased and accurate information? We further review empirical evidence on these issues, with a particular focus on healthcare, education, and finance. The empirical review covers quality measurement, the effect of third-party disclosure on consumer choice and seller behavior, as well as the economics of certifiers. (JEL D18, K32, L15, M31)},

We consider both a full-information problem, where the decision maker observes the exact value of each option as she searches, and a partial-information problem, in which the decision maker only learns the rank of the current option relative to the options that have already been observed. We develop a model that allows for a sharp contrast between search behavior in the two information settings, both theoretically and empirically. We present the results of an experiment that tests, and supports, the key prediction of our model analysis—limited information induces longer search. Our data further suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmarks in both informational settings. Importantly, subjects in our partial-information conditions are prone to stop prematurely during early stages of the search process and to suboptimally continue the search during late stages. We propose a simple model that succinctly captures the interplay of two symmetric choice and judgment biases that have asymmetric (but opposing) effects on the length of search.},

We estimate the compensated elasticity of reported income with respect to (one minus) the marginal tax rate using bunching evidence. We find clear evidence of bunching around the first kink point of the Earned Income Tax Credit but concentrated solely among the self-employed. A simple tax evasion model can account for those results. We find evidence of bunching at the threshold of the first income tax bracket where tax liability starts but no evidence of bunching at any other kink point. (JEL H23, H24, H26)},

Unannounced sales are a common supermarket practice. As we show, retailers frequently change position in the price rankings, thus making it unlikely that consumers are aware of all deals o§ered in each period. Further empirical evidence on consumer behavior is also consistent with a model with price information frictions. We develop such a model for horizontally di§erentiated products and structurally estimate the search cost distribution. The results show that in equilibrium, consumers observe a very limited number of prices before making a purchase decision, which implies that imperfect information is indeed important and that local market power is potentially high. We also show that a full information demand model yields severely biased price elasticities.},

	abstract = {Using aggregate product search data from Amazon.com, we jointly estimate consumer information search and online demand for consumer durable goods. To estimate the demand and search primitives, we introduce an optimal sequential search process into a model of choice and treat the observed market-level product search data as aggregations of individual-level optimal search sequences. The model builds on the dynamic programming framework by Weitzman [Weitzman, M. L. 1979. Optimal search for the best alternative. Econometrica 47(3) 641-654] and combines it with a choice model. It can accommodate highly complex demand patterns at the market level. At the individual level, the model has a number of attractive properties in estimation, including closed-form expressions for the probability distribution of alternative sets of searched goods and breaking the curse of dimensionality. Using numerical experiments, we verify the model's ability to identify the heterogeneous consumer tastes and search costs from product search data. Empirically, the model is applied to the online market for camcorders and is used to answer manufacturer questions about market structure and competition and to address policy-maker issues about the effect of selectively lowered search costs on consumer surplus outcomes. We demonstrate that the demand estimates from our search model predict the actual product sales ranks. We find that consumer search for camcorders at Amazon. com is typically limited to 10-15 choice options and that this affects estimates of own and cross elasticities. In a policy simulation, we also find that the vast majority of the households benefit from Amazon. com's product recommendations via lower search costs.},

Our identification of the search model relies on exclusion restriction variables that separate consumer utility and search cost. Because such exclusion restrictions are often available in online clickstream data, the identification and corresponding estimation strategy is generalizable for many online shopping websites where such data can be easily collected. Furthermore, one important feature of online search technology is that it gives consumers the ability to refine search results using tools such as sorting and filtering based on product attributes. The proposed model can coherently integrate consumers' decisions of search and refine. The model is instantiated using consumer clickstream data of online hotel bookings provided by a travel website. The results show that refinement tools have significant effects on consumer behavior and market structure. We find that the refinement tools encourage 34\% more searches and enhance the utility of purchased products by 18\%. However, most websites by default rank search results according to their qualities or relevance to consumers (e.g., Google). When consumers are unaware of such default ranking rules, they may engage in disproportionately more searches using refinement tools. Consequently, overall welfare surplus may deteriorate when search cost outweighs the enhanced utility. In contrast, if the website simply informs consumers that the default ranking already reflects product quality or relevance, consumers search less and the welfare surplus improves. We also find that refinement tools lead to a less concentrated market structure.},

By allowing search costs to be heterogeneous across consumers and products, we can directly compute the joint probability of the search sequence and the purchase decision when consumers are searching for the idiosyncratic preference shocks in their utility functions. Under this procedure, one recursively makes random draws for each dimension that requires numerical integration to simulate the probabilities associated with the purchase decision and the search sequence under the sequential search algorithm. We then present details from an extensive simulation study that compares the proposed approach with existing estimation methods recently used for sequential search model estimation, viz., the kernel-smoothed frequency simulator (KSFS) and the crude frequency simulator (CFS). In the empirical application, we apply the proposed method to the Expedia dataset from Kaggle which has previously been analyzed using the KSFS estimator and the assumption of homogeneous search costs. We demonstrate that the proposed method has a better predictive performance associated with differences in the estimated effects of various drivers of clicks and purchases, and highlight the importance of the heterogeneous search costs assumption even when KSFS is used to estimate the sequential search model. Lastly, from a managerial perspective, we show that sorting products by their expected utilities can enhance consumer welfare and increase the number of transactions.},

We use a sample of 585,578 residential properties in the Republic of Ireland - a region that legally requires rental properties to display energy performance certificates when advertised. The findings suggest that the landlord-tenant problem is present in the Irish rental market but that it is not uniform across locations, indicating the influence of other factors. To explore this further, we exploit the regional variation in rental property prices. We find a larger difference between rental and non-rental properties’ energy efficiency in markets with scarcity in rental property supply. In addition, we are able to take advantage of a unique trait in building design to compare rental and non-rental properties which were identical at the time of their construction. The findings from this sub-group mirror our finding for the sample as a whole.},

Our empirical analysis shows that the likelihood of manipulation increases when certifiers face heightened competition. This effect can be explained by the fact that certifiers, who are paid by potential sellers, are incentivized to issue more lenient certifications to attract clients. Additionally, we demonstrate that labels indicating higher energy efficiency are associated with significant house price premiums.

We test this hypothesis using  public administrative data from France, where properties' (continuous) estimated energy consumption is summarized by a (discrete) energy label on a scale from A to G. We document substantial misreporting-driven bunching of energy efficiency scores just below the relevant cut-off values, which points to labels' perceived importance. Estimates of donut RDD models show that house prices drop sharply when energy consumption crosses the boundary to a lower rating. Moreover, we observe larger price discontinuities in areas where the relation between energy efficiency and house values is harder to estimate. Finally, the discontinuities also show up in home sellers' list prices, suggesting that a simple buyer inattention story is insufficient to explain our findings.},

However, RDDs may fail to yield consistent estimates if the forcing variable can be manipulated by the agent. In this paper, we examine one interesting set of economic models with such a feature. SpeciÖcally, we examine the case where there is a structural relationship between the forcing variable and the outcome variable because they are determined simultaneously. We propose a modiÖed RDD estimator for such models and derive the conditions under which it is consistent. As an application of our method, we study contracts between a large managed care organization and leading hospitals for the provision of organ and tissue transplants. Exploiting ìdonut holesîin the reimbursement contracts we estimate how the total claims Öled by the hospitals depend on the generosity of the reimbursement structure. Our results show that hospitals submit signiÖcantly larger bills when the reimbursement rate is higher, indicating informational asymmetries between the payer and hospitals in this market.},

	abstract = {When the running variable in a regression discontinuity (RD) design is measured with error, identiﬁcation of the local average treatment eﬀect of interest will typically fail. While the form of this measurement error varies across applications, in many cases the measurement error structure is heterogeneous across diﬀerent groups of observations. We develop a novel measurement error correction procedure capable of addressing heterogeneous mismeasurement structures by leveraging auxiliary information. We also provide adjusted asymptotic variance and standard errors that take into consideration the variability introduced by the estimation of nuisance parameters, and honest conﬁdence intervals that account for potential misspeciﬁcation. Simulations provide evidence that the proposed procedure corrects the bias introduced by heterogeneous measurement error and achieves empirical coverage closer to nominal test size than “naive” alternatives. Two empirical illustrations demonstrate that correcting for measurement error can either reinforce the results of a study or provide a new empirical perspective on the data.},

Over the last two decades, statistical and econometric methods for RD analysis have expanded and matured, and there is now a large number of methodological results for RD identification, estimation, inference, and validation. We offer a curated review of this methodological literature organized around the two most popular frameworks for the analysis and interpretation of RD designs: the continuity framework and the local randomization framework. For each framework, we discuss three main topics: (a) designs and parameters, focusing on different types of RD settings and treatment effects of interest; (b) estimation and inference, presenting the most popular methods based on local polynomial regression and methods for the analysis of experiments, as well as refinements, extensions, and alternatives; and (c) validation and falsification, summarizing an array of mostly empirical approaches to support the validity of RD designs in practice.},

	abstract = {We provide new evidence that cash transfers following the birth of a ﬁrst child can have large and long-lasting eﬀects on that child’s outcomes. We take advantage of the January 1 birthdate cutoﬀ for U.S. child-related tax beneﬁts, which results in families of otherwise similar children receiving substantially diﬀerent refunds during the ﬁrst year of life. For the average low-income single-child family in our sample this diﬀerence amounts to roughly \$1,300, or 10 percent of income. Using the universe of administrative federal tax data in selected years, we show that this transfer in infancy increases young adult earnings by at least 1 to 2 percent, with larger eﬀects for males. These eﬀects show up at earlier ages in terms of improved math and reading test scores and a higher likelihood of high school graduation. The observed eﬀects on shorterrun parental outcomes suggest that additional liquidity during the critical window following the birth of a ﬁrst child leads to persistent increases in family income that likely contribute to the downstream eﬀects on children’s outcomes. The longer-term eﬀects on child earnings alone are large enough that the transfer pays for itself through subsequent increases in federal income tax revenue.},

We develop an equilibrium model of the market for ratings and use it to examine possible origins of and cures for ratings inflation. In the model, asset issuers can shop for ratings – observe multiple ratings and disclose only the most favorable – before auctioning their assets. When assets are simple, agencies' ratings are similar and the incentive to ratings shop is low. When assets are sufficiently complex, ratings differ enough that an incentive to shop emerges. Thus, an increase in the complexity of recently-issued securities could create a systematic bias in disclosed ratings, despite the fact that each ratings agency produces an unbiased estimate of the asset's true quality. Increasing competition among agencies would only worsen this problem. Switching to an investor-initiated ratings system alleviates the bias, but could collapse the market for information.},
